###### CPU Reviews
Not sure of buying a AMD's 3000 series or Intel's 9000s, here [4:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stM2CPF9YAY&list=WL&index=5&t=4s&ab_channel=LinusTechTips#t=4m21s) they have a good comparision between them. 
###### Why a new-gen CPU is better than an old-gen CPU?
In this web [article](https://www.howtogeek.com/215940/why-are-newer-generations-of-processors-faster-at-the-same-clock-speed/) they explain why newer CPUs are better than older ones, even with same clocks.
> I had a 1800X OCd to 4.025Ghz and while is a very capable CPU the 3600 has a similar MT score, a little lower at stock compared to mine but I'm sure you can match it after some mild OC. Single thread wise the 3600 is much better than the 1800X. -redditor

###### CPU possible PROBLEMS

[Here](https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/11/1638669204740559442/) its a solution for the **problem** _"Some AMD B450 chipset motherboards may need a BIOS update prior to using Matisse CPUs. Upgrading the BIOS may require a different CPU that is supported by older BIOS revisions."_

###### CPU Overcl@cking

## RAM
###### Post-instalation 
Want to know if you newer-fancy RAM is actually utilizing all his power? In this [article](https://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/613203/how-set-up-new-computer-ram-memory-after-ve-installed-it-2017/) you will be guided into activating some options at the BIOS to get your memory working 100% efficient.


## Power Supply

## Cooling
###### Fan Cooling
> When overclocking, the VOLTAGE can significantly raise the temperature. If you carefully tweak the CPU settings a **good air cooler** may give you acceptable cooling below 80degC at the maximum overclock. You may have to reduce the clock speed by say 4.4GHz vs 4.6GHz (max Turbo) however the real-world impact is relatively small. - forum guy



## Monitor 
###### Monitors for Editing
In this [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/VideoEditing/comments/j40z19/if_you_had_400_to_spend_on_a_monitor_for_editing/) discussion, people recomend a monitor with a good color spectrum, which is typycally needed for accurrate color grading. (or at least that's what I think)

> I’m a fan of the ProArt series by Asus. Their $300 27” 2k monitor is supposed to be really color accurate for the price range. Obviously it’s not HDR or P3 but I’m pretty sure it’s ~1.5 delta ranges for all of sRGB.
It also has an amazing monitor stand for the price range too. Not something people usually think about for monitors.
Edit: it also has Rec. 709 (but I’m not too familiar with that color profile) and the 24” 1080p one is less than $200 and 16:10 - redditor

## AfterEffects
Is AfterEffects more CPU or GPU based?
> Right now the majority of calculations for AE are done with CPU. They're working on getting certain effects running on GPU, but for right now it's only for a few things. The main thing inside AE that uses cuda is the very obsolete raytrace renderer, so don't bother getting a beefy GPU for that. So unless you are running a lot of GPU powered effects (like E3D) the main focus should be CPU right now. -redditor
