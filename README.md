###### Why a new-gen CPU is better than an old-gen CPU?
Newer  processorsrequire fewer instruction cycles to execute the same instructions. This can be for a large number of reasons:

Large caches mean less time wasted waiting for memory.
More execution units means less time waiting to start operating on an instruction.
Better branch prediction means less time wasted speculatively executing instructions that never actually need to be executed.
Execution unit improvements mean less time waiting for instructions to complete.
Shorter pipelines means pipelines fill up faster.
