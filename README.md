## CPU

###### CPU Reviews
- Not sure of buying a AMD's 3000 series or Intel's 9000s?

Here at min [4:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stM2CPF9YAY&list=WL&index=5&t=4s&ab_channel=LinusTechTips#t=4m21s) they have a good comparision between them. 
###### AMD's Ryzen architecture
- I this [r/explainmelikeimfive](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/6iwt75/eli5how_does_the_infinity_fabric_work/) post, redditors explain Ryzen's **Infinity Clock**(_IF_) architecture. You will learn how it is deeply connected to RAM. 
- In this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lswfgka1HnQ&ab_channel=HardwarEsfera) you will find a hard explanation about the new 3000 series processor's architecture and how it is deeply connected with RAM, emphasizing that the new series of processors that supports more than 8 cores (3600x not included) despite than linked with a RAM with 3200Mhz of "_Real bandwith_", it will only feature 1600Mhz of _"Efective bandwith"_.


###### Why a new-gen CPU is better than an old-gen CPU?
- In this web [article](https://www.howtogeek.com/215940/why-are-newer-generations-of-processors-faster-at-the-same-clock-speed/) they explain why newer CPUs are better than older ones, even with same clocks.
> I had a 1800X OCd to 4.025Ghz and while is a very capable CPU the 3600 has a similar MT score, a little lower at stock compared to mine but I'm sure you can match it after some mild OC. Single thread wise the 3600 is much better than the 1800X. -redditor

###### CPU possible PROBLEMS
- Problems with mobo actualizations. 

[Here](https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/11/1638669204740559442/) its a solution for the **problem** _"Some AMD B450 chipset motherboards may need a BIOS update prior to using Matisse CPUs. Upgrading the BIOS may require a different CPU that is supported by older BIOS revisions."_

###### CPU Overcl@cking
- If I overclock my CPU how long will it last?

In this [forum](https://forums.tomshardware.com/threads/if-i-overclock-my-cpu-how-long-will-it-last.2802893/) you will find numerous advices and experiences form overclocking users, that discuss several factors that determine CPU's lives.

## Storage
###### RAM for AMD.
###### RAM for Intel. 
- In this HardWarSfera's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2yKz0G6gA&ab_channel=HardwarEsfera) the guy features a 3200 _MHz_ RAM for the BUILD, **but** if you check **video's comment section**, you will find out that for that generation of intel(10th) RAM speed it's limited at 2933 _MHz_, and some comment recomendations for improving the build as well.

Edit: Look down below at the subheader "BUILDS" for my "Delta" build. In which you will find a PCaPartPicker built with the actuall _improvements_ that the video's comment section feature.

###### Post-instalation 
- Want to know if you newer-fancy RAM is actually utilizing all his power? 

In this [article](https://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/613203/how-set-up-new-computer-ram-memory-after-ve-installed-it-2017/) you will be guided into activating some options at the BIOS to get your memory working 100% efficient.

###### Complete guide of monitor picking.
In [**this reddit post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/92mb7r/updated_monitor_buying_guide/), you will find an _updated_ complete guide for picking your monitor. It includes an easy step-by-step process in which firstly you'll have to determine your monitor's purpose (editing, artwork, gaming, etc...), then **of course** you'll be provided by a more detailed information about _**monitor panels**_, and a lot more information relevant about the topic

- You don't trust reddit or maybe you want more info about?

In this [HowToGeek article](https://www.howtogeek.com/658701/tn-vs.-ips-vs.-va-whats-the-best-display-panel-technology/) you'll have a pretty good research dedicated only for monitor's panels.

###### Monitors for Gaming

###### Monitors for Editing
- What would you get if you had $400 to spend on a monitor for editing?

In this [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/VideoEditing/comments/j40z19/if_you_had_400_to_spend_on_a_monitor_for_editing/) discussion, people recomend a monitor with a good color spectrum, which is typycally needed for accurrate color grading. (or at least that's what I think)
> I’m a fan of the ProArt series by Asus. Their $300 27” 2k monitor is supposed to be really color accurate for the price range. Obviously it’s not HDR or P3 but I’m pretty sure it’s ~1.5 delta ranges for all of sRGB.
It also has an amazing monitor stand for the price range too. Not something people usually think about for monitors.
Edit: it also has Rec. 709 (but I’m not too familiar with that color profile) and the 24” 1080p one is less than $200 and 16:10 - redditor

## Softwares, Games, Benchmarking softwares, etc...
###### Games 
- Why Far Cry 5 uses a lot of the CPU? 

In this steam [forum](https://steamcommunity.com/app/552520/discussions/0/3211505894137235415/) you will find out why generally ubisofts games are really CPU bounded.

> This game is really cpu bound man. Pretty much any of the recent ubisoft games are pretty cpu intensive. Doesn't mean the games aren't optimized like most people would tell you. I used to have a 4690k@4.6ghz, and games like Wildlands, Watch Dogs 2, and Division would have all 4 cores pegged at 100% more than half the time creating a bottleneck for my 1080. I upgraded to a 8700k@4.8ghz with DDR4@3200mhz(old ram was ddr3@1600mhz), and my fps went from dropping down to 30's to dropping down to 80's. My 8700k averages around 40% on the same areas the 4690k was getting 100%. My advice is to upgrade your Mobo, CPU, and Ram to handle this game better. - BrainyCabde

###### AfterEffects
Is AfterEffects more CPU or GPU based?
> Right now the majority of calculations for AE are done with CPU. They're working on getting certain effects running on GPU, but for right now it's only for a few things. The main thing inside AE that uses cuda is the very obsolete raytrace renderer, so don't bother getting a beefy GPU for that. So unless you are running a lot of GPU powered effects (like E3D) the main focus should be CPU right now. -redditor
###### Benchmarking softwares
Want to know if your rig is well enough for editing, office working, or simple tasking? 
[Here](https://benchmarks.ul.com/resources/what-is-a-good-pcmark-10-score) you will get the needed benchmark score for your PC for doing editing, simple tasks and office working, also you will get a guide on how self benchmark your PC to get the score and the compare it with standards.

## Maintenance
- In this [article](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-pc-parts-tend-die-extend-lifespans/) you will find the 5 main PC components that tend to die, and how to increase their lifespan.
- Why is it important, to have a good air cooler?
> When overclocking, the VOLTAGE can significantly raise the temperature. If you carefully tweak the CPU settings, a **good air cooler** may give you acceptable cooling below 80degC at maximum overclock speeds. Also, you may have to reduce the clock speed by say 4.4GHz vs 4.6GHz(max Turbo), dont worry, despite the 2MHz decreased, the real-world impact on it will be relatively small. - forum guy

## BUILDS
_Here you will find concrete builds for specific tasks. This also features youtuber builts as well as builts I made by combining reddit/youtubecomment/youtuber ones. I didnt included a description of them, because the PCPartPicker web features an specific section for that, also because at the subheaders above you will find some info that redirectionate to these builds, so I found un-usefull to repeat the info again_
