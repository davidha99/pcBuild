###### CPU Reviews
Not sure of buying a AMD's 3000 series or Intel's 9000s, here [4:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stM2CPF9YAY&list=WL&index=5&t=4s&ab_channel=LinusTechTips#t=4m21s) they have a good comparision between them. 
###### Why a new-gen CPU is better than an old-gen CPU?
In this web [article](https://www.howtogeek.com/215940/why-are-newer-generations-of-processors-faster-at-the-same-clock-speed/) they explain why newer CPUs are better than older ones, even with same clocks.
> I had a 1800X OCd to 4.025Ghz and while is a very capable CPU the 3600 has a similar MT score, a little lower at stock compared to mine but I'm sure you can match it after some mild OC. Single thread wise the 3600 is much better than the 1800X. -redditor

###### CPU possible PROBLEMS

[Here](https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/11/1638669204740559442/) its a solution for the **problem** _"Some AMD B450 chipset motherboards may need a BIOS update prior to using Matisse CPUs. Upgrading the BIOS may require a different CPU that is supported by older BIOS revisions."_

###### Post-instalation 
Want to know if you newer-fancy RAM is actually utilizing all his power? In this [article](https://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/613203/how-set-up-new-computer-ram-memory-after-ve-installed-it-2017/) you will be guided into activating some options at the BIOS to get your memory working 100% efficient.


## Power Supply

# Softwares, Games, etc...
## AfterEffects
Is AfterEffects more CPU or GPU based?
> Right now the majority of calculations for AE are done with CPU. They're working on getting certain effects running on GPU, but for right now it's only for a few things. The main thing inside AE that uses cuda is the very obsolete raytrace renderer, so don't bother getting a beefy GPU for that. So unless you are running a lot of GPU powered effects (like E3D) the main focus should be CPU right now. -redditor
