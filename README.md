###### Why a new-gen CPU is better than an old-gen CPU?
In this web [article](https://www.howtogeek.com/215940/why-are-newer-generations-of-processors-faster-at-the-same-clock-speed/) they explain why newer CPUs are better than older ones, even with same clocks.
> I had a 1800X OCd to 4.025Ghz and while is a very capable CPU the 3600 has a similar MT score, a little lower at stock compared to mine but I'm sure you can match it after some mild OC. Single thread wise the 3600 is much better than the 1800X. -redditor
